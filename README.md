# Introduction to Data Science: Hackathon project

This repository contains documentation for the hackathon project **Representation and Recognition: Exploring Women’s Progress in Politics and Public Visibility**

The project uses the [Comparative Legislators Database](https://complegdatabase.com/) and consists of two tasks.

## First Task  
1. Interactive Map of US Senator Birthplaces 

## Second Task
I started by defining the research question: "How has female representation in politics evolved over time, and does public visibility reflect this progress?" To tackle this, I broke it down into three key questions:

- How has women’s representation in parliaments changed over time?
- Do female politicians attract more or less online attention compared to male politicians?
- How long do women remain in parliament relative to their male counterparts over time?

Using the CLD, I explored data on parliamentary participation and Wikipedia traffic for six countries. I cleaned and merged the dataset, analyzed trends for each question, and presented the findings using three visualizations. Finally, I summarized the results in a blog-style report.
